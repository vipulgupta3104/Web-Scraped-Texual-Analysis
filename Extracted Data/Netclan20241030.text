The
Problem
Faced
challenges
in
understanding
the
impact
of
positive
emotions
and
perceived
severity
of
the
pandemic
on
mental
health
and
resilience
among
entrepreneurs.
The
goal
was
to
provide
a
detailed
analysis
and
predictive
models
to
help
comprehend
these
interactions
and
their
implications.
Our
Solution
We
developed
a
comprehensive
solution
involving
descriptive,
inquisitive,
and
predictive
analytics.
This
included
formulating
hypotheses,
performing
exploratory
factor
analysis,
designing
predictive
models,
and
visualizing
interactions
through
graphs
and
tables.
Our
solution
aimed
to
provide
actionable
insights
into
the
relationships
between
positive
emotions,
perceived
severity
of
the
pandemic,
and
mental
health.
Solution
Architecture

Data
collection
and
preprocessing

Exploratory
Factor
Analysis
(EFA)
to
identify
key
indicators

Regression
analysis
to
understand
relationships
between
variables

Structural
Equation
Modeling
(SEM)
to
visualize
and
quantify
interactions

Creation
of
detailed
tables
and
figures
for
publication
Deliverables

Descriptive
statistics
table

Fit
statistics
table
for
hypothesized
and
modified
models

SEM
results
with
coefficients
and
interaction
effects

Visualizations
of
interactions
between
resiliency,
perceived
severity
of
the
pandemic,
positive
emotions,
and
mental
health

Comprehensive
report
with
charts,
tables,
results,
and
methodology
Tech
Stack
Tools
used
Jupyter
Notebook,
Python
Libraries
Language/techniques
used
Python,
Exploratory
Factor
Analysis,
Regression
Analysis,
Models
used
Ordinary
Least
Squares
(OLS),
Factor
Analysis,
Structural

(SEM)
Skills
used
Data
preprocessing,
feature
engineering,
statistical
analysis,
model
evaluation,
data

Databases
used
CSV
files
containing
survey
data.
What
are
the
technical
Challenges
Faced
during
Project
Execution
We
faced
challenges
with
missing
data,
which
affected
the
accuracy
of
the
models.
Integrating
different
data
sources
and
ensuring
data
quality
were
also
significant
hurdles.
How
the
Technical
Challenges
were
Solved
We
used
data
imputation
techniques
to
handle
missing
values
and
implemented
robust
data
cleaning
processes.
For
integration,
we
used
efficient
ETL
(Extract,
Transform,
Load)
pipelines
to
ensure
seamless
data
flow.
Business
Impact
The
project
provided
Jean
Kabongo
with
valuable
insights
into
the
factors
affecting
entrepreneurial
resilience
during
the
pandemic.
The
detailed
analysis
and
predictive
models
helped
in
understanding
the
key
drivers
of
mental
health
and
provided
a
foundation
for
further
research
and
intervention
strategies.
