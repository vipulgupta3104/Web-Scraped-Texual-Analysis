Project
Objective
The
objective
of
this
project
was
to
build
a
Physics
Informed
Neural
Network
(PINN)
using
TensorFlow,
which
could
evaluate
circuits
based
on
the
parameters
provided
through
a
MATLAB
simulation.
Project
Description
Mohamed
provided
us
with
a
dataset
generated
from
a
MATLAB
simulation
of
a
circuit,
consisting
of
various
input
parameters
and
the
corresponding
circuit
performance
outputs.
We
were
tasked
with
developing
a
machine
learning
model
that
could
accurately
predict
circuit
performance
based
on
the
input
parameters,
while
also
incorporating
the
underlying
physics
principles
that
govern
circuit
behavior.
Our
Solution
Our
team
utilized
Jupyter
Notebook,
Google
Colab,
Octave,
and
MATLAB
to
build
the
PINN.
We
used
TensorFlow
models
to
build
the
neural
network
and
Microsoft
Excel
to
clean
and
preprocess
the
data.
Our
team
employed
Python
programming,
TensorFlow,
Pandas,
and
MATLAB
skills
to
build
the
PINN.
We
did
not
use
any
databases
for
this
project,
nor
did
we
use
any
web/cloud
servers.
Project
Deliverables
The
final
deliverable
was
a
functional
PINN
capable
of
evaluating
circuits
based
on
the
provided
parameters.
Tools
used
Our
team
used
Jupyter
Notebook,
Google
Colab,
Octave,
MATLAB,
and
Microsoft
Excel.
Language/techniques
used
The
primary
languages
and
techniques
we
used
were
Python
programming,
TensorFlow,
and
MATLAB.
Models
used
We
used
TensorFlow
models
to
build
the
neural
network
for
the
PINN.
Skills
used
Our
team
utilized
Python
programming,
TensorFlow,
Pandas,
and
MATLAB
skills
to
build
the
PINN.
Databases
used
We
did
not
use
any
databases
for
this
project.
Web
Cloud
Servers
used
We
did
not
use
any
web/cloud
servers
for
this
project.
What
are
the
technical
Challenges
Faced
during
Project
Execution
The
project
was
very
challenging
since
our
team
did
not
have
a
background
in
electrical
engineering.
It
was
difficult
to
understand
the
physics
behind
the
circuit
evaluation,
and
we
faced
issues
when
using
MATLAB
to
provide
data
for
the
project.
How
the
Technical
Challenges
were
Solved
We
worked
with
the
client
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
physics
behind
the
circuit
evaluation.
We
also
worked
with
MATLAB
experts
to
help
us
better
understand
how
to
provide
data
for
the
project.
Business
Impact
The
PINN
we
built
for
Mohamed
Zamil
allowed
for
efficient
circuit
evaluation
and
improved
the
overall
accuracy
of
the
evaluation
process.
