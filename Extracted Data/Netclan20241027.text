The
Problem
To
improve
the
accuracy
to
90%+
where
the
current
models
which
were
built
were
giving
an
accuracy
of
58%.
The
existing
predictive
models
are
currently
achieving
an
accuracy
of
58%,
which
is
insufficient
for
meeting
the
desired
performance
benchmarks.
The
objective
is
to
enhance
the
accuracy
of
these
models
to
exceed
90%.
This
requires
a
comprehensive
evaluation
and
improvement
of
the
model
development
process,
including
data
quality,
feature
engineering,
algorithm
selection,
and
hyperparameter
tuning.
The
challenge
lies
in
identifying
and
implementing
effective
strategies
to
significantly
boost
the
model’s
predictive
accuracy
while
ensuring
robustness
and
generalizability.
Our
Solution
Our
solution
architecture
is
designed
to
efficiently
preprocess
financial
data,
perform
feature
selection,
and
train
a
GRU
(Gated
Recurrent
Unit)
model
for
predictive
analysis.
The
architecture
comprises
the
following
components:
Data
Preprocessing:
Involves
loading
the
dataset
from
a
CSV
file,
checking
for
null
values,
and
performing
initial
exploratory
data
analysis
(EDA).
Feature
Selection:
Utilizes
correlation
analysis
to
identify
relevant
features
and
drop
irrelevant
ones.
Model
Building:
Constructs
a
GRU
model
using
TensorFlow’s
Keras
API,
consisting
of
multiple
GRU
layers
followed
by
dropout
regularization
and
a
dense
output
layer
with
a
sigmoid
activation
function.
Model
Evaluation:
Evaluates
the
trained
model
on
test
data
to
measure
its
performance.

What
are
the
technical
Challenges
Faced
during
Project
Execution
Handling
data
variability:
Dealing
with
varying
data
formats
and
distributions
across
different
datasets.
Feature
selection:
Identifying
relevant
features
and
discarding
irrelevant
ones
to
improve
model
performance.
Model
optimization:
Tuning
hyperparameters
and
optimizing
the
architecture
of
the
GRU
model
for
better
accuracy
and
generalization.
