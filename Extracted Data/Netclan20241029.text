The
Problem
Our
client,
a
leading
research
institution,
faced
challenges
in
collecting
rich,
engaging
data
through
traditional
survey
methods.
Participants
often
found
surveys
tedious
and
uninteresting,
leading
to
low
response
rates
and
limited
insights.
Additionally,
the
client
sought
a
way
to
accommodate
participants
who
preferred
verbal
communication
over
written
responses.
Our
Solution
To
address
these
challenges,
proposed
integrating
Generative
AI
technology
into
the
Qualtrics
platform.
This
would
allow
for
dynamic,
AI-driven
conversations
with
participants,
making
the
survey
experience
more
interactive
and
personalized.
Additionally,
we
suggested
implementing
speech-to-text
functionality
to
cater
to
participants
who
preferred
vocalizing
their
responses.
Solution
Architecture
In
solution
involved
integrating
ChatGPT
and
Gemini
AI
models
into
the
Qualtrics
environment.
Participants
could
engage
in
conversations
with
the
AI
either
by
typing
or
speaking
their
prompts.
Speech
inputs
were
processed
using
Gemini’s
speech-to-text
capabilities,
enabling
seamless
interaction
with
the
AI
models.

What
are
the
technical
Challenges
Faced
during
Project
Execution
Real-time
Integration:
Achieving
seamless
real-time
integration
of
AI
models
with
Qualtrics
proved
challenging
due
to
the
asynchronous
nature
of
the
platforms.
Speech-to-Text
Accuracy:
Ensuring
accurate
transcription
of
speech
inputs
posed
a
technical
challenge,
especially
in
noisy
environments
or
with
accented
speech.

Simulated
AI
Model:
To
overcome
real-time
integration
challenges,
we
implemented
a
simulated
AI
model
that
generated
personalized
responses
based
on
user
prompts.
Enhanced
Speech
Processing:
We
fine-tuned
Gemini’s
speech-to-text
capabilities
to
improve
accuracy
and
robustness,
enabling
reliable
transcription
of
verbal
inputs.
Business
Impact
Improved
Participant
Engagement:
The
implementation
of
AI-driven
conversations
led
to
higher
participant
engagement
and
increased
survey
completion
rates.
Richer
Data
Collection:
Participants
provided
more
detailed
and
nuanced
responses,
leading
to
richer
datasets
and
deeper
insights
for
the
client’s
research
initiatives.
