They

Our
Solution
First,
we
fetch
the
data
from
CRM
to
PowerBI.
Clean
the
data
of
CRM
using
DAX
and
then
perform
calculations
on
the
data.
Using
cleaned
data,
we
build
KPI
on
PowerBI.

Merging
the
Data
How
the
Technical
Challenges
were
Solved
Solution:
To
Fetch
the
data
from
CRM.
We
used
Zapier.
It
is
connector
between
two
applications
so
that
whenever
a
particular
incident
happen
it
will
populate
into
another
application.
We
use
Zapier
to
connect
CRM
and
Google
sheets
so
that
whenever
a
new
lead
will
change
or
modified
data
will
be
stored
into
google
sheets.
Data
in
google
sheets
was
uncleaned.
First,
we
connect
the
Google
sheet
with
PowerbI
then
perform
EDA
to
clean
the
data
using
DAX
language.
Using
merging
of
two
tables
by
ONE-ON-ONE
schema
we
solve
duplicate
entries
of
a
particular
lead
in
PowerBI.
Business
Impact

this

many
are
actually
a
Sale.
They
can
keep
track
of
their
sales
leadership
of
employee
