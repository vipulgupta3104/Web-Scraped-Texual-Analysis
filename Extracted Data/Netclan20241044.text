Client
Background
Client:
A
leading
sports
tech
firm
in
the
USA
Industry
Type:
Sports
Products
&amp;
Services:
Sports
Management,
SaaS
Organization
Size:
100+
The
Problem
The
client
aimed
to
develop
a
sophisticated
sports
prediction
model
capable
of
forecasting
game
outcomes
across
five
major
sports
leagues:
NCAAFB,
NHL,
NFL,
NBA,
and
MLB.
The
primary
challenge
was
to
leverage
historical
data
and
statistical
inputs
to
accurately
predict
game
winners.
The
project
required
integrating
data
from
the
SportRadar
API,
processing
it
efficiently,
and
utilizing
machine
learning
techniques
to
train
a
predictive
model.
The
ultimate
goal
was
to
provide
real-time
predictions
that
could
assist
in
sports
betting
strategies
or
enhance
fan
engagement.
Our
Solution
The
proposed
solution
involved
creating
a
comprehensive
sports
prediction
model
using
Python,
leveraging
the
SportRadar
API
for
data
acquisition,
and
storing
the
data
in
Google
Cloud
Storage.
The
project
was
structured
around
a
modular
approach,
with
each
sport
having
its
dedicated
script
(`{sport_name}.py`)
for
data
processing
and
model
training.
The
development
workflow
included:
–
**Data
Collection**:
Utilizing
the
SportRadar
API
to
gather
historical
data
for
the
past
3-4
seasons.
–
**Data
Processing**:
Storing
the
data
in
Google
Cloud
Storage
and
processing
it
into
a
structured
format
suitable
for
model
training.
–
**Model
Training**:
Preparing
the
data
for
model
training,
focusing
on
converting
JSON
data
to
tabular
format
and
fetching
relevant
team
stats.
–
**Prediction**:
Developing
the
predictive
model
to
forecast
game
outcomes
based
on
historical
data
and
statistical
inputs.

What
are
the
technical
Challenges
Faced
during
Project
Execution
Data
Collection
and
Storage:
Collecting
data
for
the
past
3-4
seasons’
schedules,
team
stats,
and
game
stats
from
the
SportRadar
API
and
storing
it
in
GCP
was
a
significant
challenge.
Data
Processing:
Processing
the
raw
data
to
create
a
DataFrame
and
augmenting
it
with
necessary
statistics
was
another
challenge.
Model
Training:
Training
the
model
with
the
processed
data
to
predict
game
outcomes
was
a
complex
task
due
to
the
vast
amount
of
data
and
the
need
for
accurate
predictions.
How
the
Technical
Challenges
were
Solved
Data
Collection
and
Storage:
The
data
was
collected
through
the
SportRadar
API
and
stored
in
a
Google
Cloud
Storage
bucket
named
‘data_parlayy’.
The
GCP
client
was
configured
using
a
service
account
JSON
key
obtained
from
an
environment
variable
GCS_Service_Account_JSON_KEY.
Data
Processing:
The
raw
data
was
processed
through
various
steps
to
create
a
DataFrame
and
augment
it
with
necessary
statistics.
Model
Training:
The
model
training
involves
converting
game
summary
and
statistics
data
from
JSON
to
tabular
format,
fetching
team
stats,
and
past
game
stats.
The
team
stats
and
past
few
games
stats
are
already
processed
and
ready
for
training.
Business
Impact
The
implementation
of
the
sports
prediction
model
has
the
potential
to
significantly
impact
the
sports
betting
and
fan
engagement
industries.
By
providing
accurate
predictions
of
game
outcomes,
the
model
can
assist
in
sports
betting
strategies
or
fan
engagement
activities
by
providing
great
insights.
This
can
lead
to
improved
decision-making
processes,
increased
operational
efficiency,
and
strategic
planning
within
the
sports
betting
and
fan
engagement
industries.
