The
Problem
Create
a
ROASing
dashboard
to
fetch
google
ads
budget
spent
data
using
google
ads
api(campaign-wise).
The
challenge
is
to
develop
a
ROAS
(Return
on
Ad
Spend)
dashboard
that
efficiently
retrieves
and
displays
Google
Ads
budget
spent
data
on
a
campaign-wise
basis
using
the
Google
Ads
API.
The
current
system
lacks
a
streamlined
method
for
tracking
and
analyzing
ad
spend
across
various
campaigns,
leading
to
difficulties
in
assessing
performance
and
optimizing
budget
allocation.
The
goal
is
to
create
a
comprehensive
dashboard
that
accurately
fetches
and
visualizes
budget
data,
enabling
more
effective
analysis
and
decision-making.
This
involves
integrating
with
the
Google
Ads
API,
ensuring
data
accuracy,
and
providing
clear,
actionable
insights
for
better
campaign
management.
