Project
Description
Our
client,
Arik
Oganesian,
approached
us
with
a
requirement
to
create
a
dashboard
for
his
friend’s
e-commerce
website,
Symbiome.
The
dashboard
needed
to
be
visually
appealing
and
provide
comprehensive
insights
into
the
website’s
performance.
We
sourced
data
from
various
sources
such
as
Bigquery
Database,
Google
Ads,
Google
Analytics,
and
Facebook
Ads.
To
create
the
dashboard,
we
used
Google
Data
Studio
and
Google
Sheets
to
link
the
data
sources.
We
also
used
SQL
language
to
extract
data
from
Bigquery
Database.
The
client
specifically
asked
for
cohort
retention
and
cohort
revenue
charts
to
be
included
in
the
dashboard.
With
our
expertise
in
data
analytics,
we
were
able
to
fulfill
the
client’s
requirements
and
provide
a
dashboard
that
helped
the
client
make
data-driven
decisions.

What
are
the
technical
Challenges
Faced
during
Project
Execution
One
of
the
major
challenges
we
faced
was
extracting
data
from
Bigquery
Database
using
SQL
language.
However,
we
were
able
to
overcome
this
challenge
by
using
our
expertise
in
data
analytics.
How
the
Technical
Challenges
were
Solved
To
solve
this
issue,
we
used
Google
Data
Studio
and
Google
Sheets
to
link
the
data
sources.
We
also
used
SQL
language
to
extract
data
from
Bigquery
Database.
By
using
these
tools,
we
were
able
to
integrate
the
data
from
different
sources
and
create
a
single
comprehensive
dashboard
that
met
the
client’s
requirements.
Business
Impact
The
dashboard
we
created
provided
a
clear
view
of
the
website’s
performance
and
helped
the
client
to
make
data-driven
decisions.
This
resulted
in
an
increase
in
website
traffic
and
revenue.
