The
Problem
The
primary
challenge
is
developing
a
backend
model
for
an
application
that
captures
audio
responses
from
students
and
employs
AI
to
analyze
the
content.
The
backend
must
perform
several
critical
functions:
Convert
audio
to
text.
Transform
the
text
into
analytics
KPIs.
Manage
login/logout
operations.
Handle
analytics
API
calls.
Calculate
the
cosine
similarity
of
the
student’s
response
with
the
expected
response.
Solution
Architecture
To
address
this
problem,
we
propose
using
Python
for
backend
development,
leveraging
several
key
steps:
Audio
to
Text
Conversion:
Utilize
the
SpeechRecognition
library
in
Python
for
converting
audio
inputs
into
text.
This
library
is
known
for
its
ease
of
use
and
flexibility,
acting
as
a
wrapper
for
several
popular
speech
APIs
35.
Text
Analysis:
Apply
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP)
techniques
to
the
converted
text,
including
sentiment
analysis,
readability
analysis,
and
named
entity
recognition
(NER).
Libraries
such
as
NLTK
and
SpaCy
will
be
used
for
these
purposes.
User
Authentication:
Implement
a
secure
authentication
system
using
JWT
tokens
to
manage
login
and
logout
operations.
API
Creation:
Use
Flask,
a
lightweight
Python
framework,
to
create
APIs
for
managing
user
sessions
and
handling
analytics
data.
Data
Storage:
Employ
a
relational
database
like
PostgreSQL
to
store
user
session
data,
user
profiles,
and
analytics
data.
Deployment:
Deploy
the
application
on
a
cloud
platform
such
as
AWS
or
Google
Cloud.
The
architecture
of
the
solution
involves
a
backend
model
developed
using
Python,
APIs
for
managing
user
sessions
and
analytics
data,
a
secure
user
authentication
system,
and
capabilities
for
converting
audio
to
text
and
performing
text
analysis.

What
are
the
technical
Challenges
Faced
during
Project
Execution
Challenge:
Ensuring
accurate
audio
to
text
conversion,
especially
with
poor
audio
quality
or
heavy
accents.
Solution:
Use
a
robust
speech
recognition
library
that
supports
multiple
languages
and
dialects.
Implement
a
mechanism
for
users
to
manually
edit
the
transcribed
text
for
accuracy.
Business
Impact
Enhanced
Student
Engagement:
Providing
immediate
feedback
on
student
responses
can
foster
a
more
engaging
learning
environment.
Improved
Learning
Outcomes:
Detailed
analytics
can
aid
educators
in
understanding
student
learning
patterns
and
identifying
areas
where
students
struggle.
Cost
Savings:
Automating
the
conversion
of
audio
to
text
and
the
generation
of
analytics
can
significantly
reduce
manual
labor
costs.
Scalability:
The
use
of
scalable
technologies
allows
the
system
to
handle
increasing
volumes
of
student
responses
without
compromising
performance.
Data
Insights:
The
system
generates
valuable
data
insights,
including
sentiment
scores,
readability
metrics,
and
named
entity
recognition
counts.
Customer
Satisfaction:
A
seamless,
efficient
experience
for
both
students
and
educators
can
enhance
customer
satisfaction.
This
project
is
aligned
with
the
organization’s
strategic
goals,
and
the
business
impact
analysis
will
ensure
that
potential
disruptions
are
identified
and
managed
effectively.
